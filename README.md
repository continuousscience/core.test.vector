Sil vector tests
==================

This is a repository of live sil code.  It demonstrates
the coding style for defining and using primitive operations
(like the ineffable vector).

The contents can be referenced from any other sil module
using the url `sil://core.test.vector/2017-02-24T00:00:00MST`
to specify the project path and date.

The results from running the code can be downloaded
from the main sil server,
`https://sque.predictivestatmech.org/projects/core.test.vector`

The killer feature that's visible here is how the library includes
work seamlessly across projects.  Sil code is extensible and freely
composable.

Sil is much bigger than this example.
